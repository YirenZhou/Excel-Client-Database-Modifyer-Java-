# Excel Client Datasource Modifier 
Microsoft Office Excel is the ultimate weapon in the field of finance, while programming languages are crucial in the field of computer science and engineering. Being an employee at Manulife, dealing with tons of data is regular but also painstaking. Workbooks are so huge that sometimes it is so easy to make mistakes. I decided to develop a program that help me simplify my work: hand the task to a computer and let it do the work.

The current functions of the program are: adding, removing client, and search for a client in our database. 
1. Adding clients: if the client's work area exists in our system, the program only requires a single input of CC number and it would automatically update the corresponding information. 
2. Removing clients: after finding the client in our system, it automatically erases all the information about the client and transfer it to another worksheet called "Unsubscribed"â€‹.
3. Searching for a client: it could automatically display the client's all-round information.
4. Modify / edit a specific portion of content directly and save the file.
5. Take in suggested features and reported problems from the user
